        <span style="font-size: 40px;">W</span>hether flying a small model rocket or launching a giant cargo rocket to Mars, the principles of how rockets work are exactly the same.
        Understanding and applying these principles means
mission success.<br><br>
In the early days of rocketry, the flight of a fire
arrow or other rocket device was largely a matter
of chance. It might fly; it might skitter about, shooting sparks and smoke; or it might explode. Through
centuries of trial and error, rockets became more
reliable. However, real advancements in rocketry
depended upon a scientific and mathematical
understanding of motion. That came in the seventeenth century with the works of scientists such as
Galileo and Isaac Newton.<br><br>
Galileo conducted a wide range of experiments
involving motion. Through studies of inclined
planes, Galileo concluded that moving objects
did not need the continuous application of force
(in the absence of friction and drag) to keep moving. Galileo discovered the principle of inertia, that
all matter, because of its mass, resists changes in
motion. The more mass, the more resistance.
Isaac Newton, born the year Galileo died, advanced
Galileo’s discoveries and those of others by proposing three basic laws of motion. These laws are the
foundation of all rocket science. Understand the
laws and you know just about everything you need
to build successful rockets. Apply the laws and you
become a “rocket scientist. <br><br><br><br>

<span style="font-size: 40px;">Newton's laws of motion</span><br><br>

In his master work entitled Philosophia Naturalis
Principia Mathematica (usually referred to as
Principia), Isaac Newton stated his laws of motion.
For the most part, the laws were known intuitively
by rocketeers, but their statement in clear form
elevated rocketry to a science. Practical application
of Newton’s laws makes the difference between failure and success. The laws relate force and direction
to all forms of motion.<br><br>
    
        <div class="laws">
           <span style="font-size: 2vw; font-weight: bolder;"> First Law</span><br>
Objects at rest remain at rest and objects in
motion remain in motion in a straight
line unless acted upon by an
unbalanced force. <br><br>
<span style="font-size: 2vw; font-weight: bolder;"> Second Law</span><br>
Force equals mass times acceleration
(or f = ma).<br><br>
<span style="font-size: 2vw; font-weight: bolder;"> Third Law</span><br>
For every action there is an equal and
opposite reaction.  <br>
